        <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms," "Terms of Service") carefully before using the ZAININ AI web application (the "Service") operated by [Your Name/Company Name] ("us," "we," or "our").</p>

        <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>

        <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>

        <h2>1. API Keys</h2>
        <p>The Service requires you to provide your own API keys for third-party AI model providers (such as OpenRouter) and optional web search providers (such as SerpApi). You are solely responsible for obtaining these keys, understanding and complying with the terms and pricing of these third-party services, and for any costs incurred through their use. Your API keys are stored locally in your browser's local storage and are not stored on our servers. We are not responsible for the security of your API keys on your device.</p>

        <h2>2. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Service and its original content (excluding user-submitted content and AI-generated content), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of [Your Name/Company Name].</p>
        <p>AI-generated responses are produced by third-party models. The intellectual property rights regarding AI output may vary depending on the terms of the specific third-party provider and the applicable laws.</p>

        <h2>3. User Content</h2>
        <p>You retain any and all of your rights to any content you submit, post, or display on or through the Service (your "User Content"). By posting User Content, you grant us a license to store and display your chat history within the Service for your personal use.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for the content you post and for ensuring it complies with all applicable laws and the terms of the third-party AI providers.</p>

        <h2>4. Links To Other Web Sites</h2>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by [Your Name/Company Name].</p>
        <p>[Your Name/Company Name] has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party web sites or services.</p>

        <h2>5. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
        <p>You may terminate your account by ceasing to use the Service. Note that there is no built-in UI for full Firebase account deletion; this may require manual steps or contacting Firebase support.</p>

        <h2>6. Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied.</p>

By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>
