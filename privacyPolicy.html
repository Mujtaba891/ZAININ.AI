        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: [Current Date]</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how ZAININ AI ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our web application (the "Service").</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information when you use the Service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Account Information:** When you sign up, we collect your email address.</li>
            <li>**Chat Data:** Messages you send and receive through the chat are stored. Note that messages sent to the AI are processed by third-party AI providers (OpenRouter, SerpApi) and may be used by them according to their own privacy policies.</li>
            <li>**API Keys:** If you provide API keys for AI services or web search, these are stored locally in your browser's local storage. We do not store your API keys on our servers.</li>
            <li>**Usage Data:** Information about how you access and use the Service, such as chat timestamps and feature usage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the Service, including storing and retrieving your chat history.</li>
            <li>Communicate with you regarding your account.</li>
            <li>Facilitate AI responses by sending necessary message context to third-party AI providers.</li>
            <li>Improve, personalize, and expand our Service.</li>
            <li>Monitor and analyze usage and trends.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <p>We share your information only in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Third-Party AI Providers:** Your chat messages are sent to third-party AI model providers (like OpenRouter) and search providers (like SerpApi, if enabled). Your use of these features is subject to their respective terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for how these third parties use your data.</li>
            <li>**With Your Consent:** We may disclose your information with your explicit consent.</li>
            <li>**Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.</li>
        </ul>

         <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Your account information and chat history are stored securely using Firebase services. Please refer to Firebase's security policies for details on how they handle data.</li>
             <li>Your API keys are stored *only* in your browser's local storage and are not transmitted to our servers. While this prevents server-side storage, local storage is not immune to security risks if your browser or device is compromised.</li>
             <li>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information, but no system is entirely secure.</li>
         </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your account information and chat history for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service. You can delete your account through Firebase if desired (this feature is not currently built into the UI). Deleting a chat within the app removes it from our Firebase storage.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of [e.g., 13 or 16, depending on regulations]. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [Your Contact Email or Method].</p>
